## Hello all! I am Hannah Fulk!

I am a junior at [Christopher Newport University] (cnu.edu) and I am a Communication Studies major with a focus in Interpersonal Studies and a minor in Writing. I am from central Virginia and have lived there my entire life until going to CNU and living on campus in Newport News! 

I am enrolled in Digital Humanities because it aids my writing minor. Most of the writing I have done/ studied has not been connected to digital humanities so this course is expanding my knowledge on the digital world! I definitely see the importance of studying DH already even though I have only attended a handful of classes thus far! In our ever changing, progressive, digitally driven world DH is more important to learn than ever. 

A little bit more about who I am! I am a type 8 on the enneagram with a wing 7 and an ESFP. My enneagram reveals I am a challenger and my type reveals I am **self confident, decisive, willful, independent, and confrontational**. 

My Meyers Briggs personality reveals I am an [ESFP] (https://www.16personalities.com/esfp-personality) which stands for extroverted, observant, feeling, and prospecting. I am quite extroverted and love to be surrounded by friends and family and can engage in conversations effortlessly. I am observant in that I pay close attention to the feelings of others around me and genuinely care about those I surround myself with. Feeling is also included in this description meaning I am very intune with myself and my own feelings and I am unafraid to share those feelings with others. Lastly, my personality type shows I am prospecting which implies I am always seeking new opportunities and adventures in my life and will not stop looking for those things! 

I have a few on campus involvements as well! I am the **Vice President of Public Relations and Recruitment** for my sorority, Alpha Sigma Alpha. I serve on the executive board and oversee our Panhellenic Delegate and our Public Relations Chairman. I plan and execute informal recruitment while maintaining constant communication with our 60 chapter members ensuring they are informed of all necessary events and leadership opportunities. 

I am also a Resident Assistant employed at Christopher Newport University. I am a direct resource for my 40 person hall and continuously strive to implement a sense of community in our building and in our hall for second year students. I am responsible for ensuring the safety of my residents and all residents living in the residence hall.
