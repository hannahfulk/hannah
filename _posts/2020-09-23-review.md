 Daniel Goddemeyer, Moritz Stefaner, Dominikus Baur, and Lev Manovich created On Broadway with the purpose of explaining life on Broadway through an individual’s lifestyles, habits, locations, and photos. The reader sees a breakdown of data and images to grow their knowledge about Broadway and the people who live there or travel through there. The authors sought to find connections between people on Broadway and they have shown those connections through graphics and illustrations. This is an interactive digitail humanties project that allows the reader to control where they look to receive necessary data. 
 
 The **video** is the first interactive section on the website; it shows a video of what you are able to observe under the installation tab. There are no words or music playing; it is a recording of the accessible information they have collected. This information is all available and explained in the installation section so the video was unnecessary; it was not engaging to the audience and did not leave them wanting to know more.  
 
 Through the **background explanation**, we are able to see the inspiration behind this work which was the book Every Building on the Sunset Strip by Edward Ruscha. This is an interesting piece of information given to the reader because they are allowed to see what encourages and motivates authors. Is also a hyperlink that takes you to an article about this book so the audience is able to gather all the information that they would need simply and effectively. 
 
 The **data section** of this work aims to break down and analyze income, taxi drop-offs, taxi pickups, it's true images and, Foursquare check-ins. They have included many graphics trying to show the resemblance of all these factors to each other. The execution of this data section could have been portrayed in a more effective way. All the reader can see right now is maps of streets (specifically Broadway) and an in-depth breakdown of individuals who went down Broadway. To explain why they thought this data was relevant instead of providing their reader with the data. 
 
 The **installation section** of this digital humanities project gave a simple breakdown of the 13 different “layers” Project and where those layers are what they explained and listed. This breakdown would have been beneficial for the reader to have at the beginning of the project because they would be able to have an idea of what to look at in which section of the website. Since this website contains a lot of information, it is nice to have an overview of what certain sections look at and what information is available to the reader. 
 
 This project is very well done. The authors provide a lot of interesting data that gives the reader an insight into what life on Broadway looks like. Yet, there are some structural changes I would suggest implementing. There is a lot of information so the reader may struggle to identify the right information in the right places. The breakdown of information present under the 'installation' section (https://github.com/hannahfulk/hannah/blob/master/images/SectionBreakdown.JPG)  could have been located at the beginning as a guide for what the reading was about and where to look for the information they need. I enjoy **‘The Application’** that allows the reader to see specific breakdowns of color, images, Instagram photos, and statistics. The reader has complete power over this section and where ever they would like to click and look at. This is very interactive and entertaining and provides some originality to this project.
