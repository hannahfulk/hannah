## **Grant Project Progress** 
---
My grant project is looking at the impact of technology and technological advancements on education/ teaching in the school system throughout the decades. This research will then be presented in an interactive timeline so one can see the development over the past 50+ years. The research I have done for this project thus far has been more challenging than I originally thought it would be. A part reason for this struggle is that recently, in 2020, there has been an immense focus on technological learning and new digital advancements so many articles are about this year specifically. While that information is still useable and constructive, I am also looking to find information from many decades in the past so I am able to see the changes and advancements develop over time. Another issue I have found is that many writings are looking toward the future of the educational system and the technological impact that is yet to come, which is not my area of focus for this grant. Other than those two minor research flaws, my studies have been successful because technological development in schools is a very prevalent topic that many scholars have researched. 

I have been able to find information from many different decades and one source that helped me see these developments clearly was The Campus Computing Project which provides an annual breakdown of new technological developments in education since 1994. Each of the surveys they provide helps me to see what path my project could take and also allows me to have a great reference tool. While this project does an effective job at breaking down annual findings and reports, my project will not be looking at each year, but instead will look at a generalization and summary of each decadeâ€™s major findings. My project will also differ from The Campus Computing Project because I will provide a timeline breakdown over the years whereas The Campus Computing Project simply linked their annual surveys in descending order, starting from the most current survey. You can see a few of the linked surveys and their structure presented on the website below.

My project has shifted and developed into something more specified and clear than I originally laid out in my abstract. My abstract was very general in stating the intention behind my research which was centered around college students and alumni and their college experience. I have adjusted this project to make it look more at the technological impact and advancements in all types of education and educational systems. I also did not have a plan for how I wanted the structure of the project to look. I have now decided I would like it to be in a timeline format which helps with the readability and effortless transportation of information for the reader.
